This repository contains example Python code that demonstrates a common error: the failure to handle empty lists and unexpected data types when calculating averages. The original code raises a TypeError when faced with non-numeric data.  The solution provides a more robust function that checks for and handles both empty lists and non-numeric elements, providing a more reliable average calculation.  The included tests ensure the updated function handles various edge cases correctly.
